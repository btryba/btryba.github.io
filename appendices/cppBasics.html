                <h1>C++ Basics</h1>
                <h3>What is Unique about C++</h3>
                <p>C++ is a systems langauge and it is compiled. What does that mean? It means that
                    you have a lot of control of what is going on. When you use a very high level
                    scripting langauge, you have a langauge that is designed to do a lot of the work
                    for you. This will save you time in developing because you have the computer
                    helping you. As you get into lower and lower langauges, you have less and less
                    computer automated steps and help.
                </p>
                <p>One way to understand the control you have is to compare it to a high level
                    language where you have less control. If we look at Javascript for example.
                    First this is an interpreted language rather than a compiled langauge. This
                    means that the code you write is being converted into machine code <i>while</i>
                    it is being run. This is a slightly slower process since the computer is working
                    on understanding your code during operation. And it does this process everytime
                    the code is run. So this is a slightly slower process. However, a benefit is 
                    that you have duck typing.
                </p>
                <p>What is duck typing. Well if it looks like a duck and sounds like a duck, it must
                    be a duck. It means that if you create a variable and you assign it a number, it
                    must be a number. If you assign a string to it, it must be a string. In C++, the
                    language is compiled and that means that the computer is not able at run time to
                    determine what type it is while it is being run. As a developer this means that
                    you must tell it the type. If it is an integer, you say it is an int. If it is a
                    decimal value, you say it is a float or a double. Again, you are in control.
                </p>
                <p>So far we have dicussed that C++ is compiled meaning the computer isn't reading your
                    code during runtime. Meaning that it reads it all and converts it to machine code during
                    "compile-time". There is another document describing compiling in detail 
                    <a href="compilerBasics.html">here.</a> For sake of this document, you just need to know
                    that after you write your code you need to convert it into machine code using a compiler.
                    The other thing we have seen is that due to compiling you need to specify the types of every.
                    Why is this? As you get into compiled lanagues you become more and more concerned about the
                    memory that the computer is using.
                </p>
                <p>Technically there is a type of language between our mid-level language of C++ and
                    the high level language of Javascript. Those are languages like C# and Java. These
                    languages are sometimes called, half-compiled. They are faster than intrepreted
                    languages, but the computer still reads it during runtime so that you have more
                    features.
                </p>
                <h3>One Language to Rule them All?</h3>
                <p>This is why there are more than one type of language. You need to pick a language
                    that fits your needs. If you want a language that practically writes itself, and
                    speed and size are not an issue. Go as high level as you can. If you need a language
                    that allows you tweak the internal componets of the computer processor and allows
                    you to do tricks to reuse the computer's memory in unusual ways, go low level.
                </p>
                <p>C++ is what is sometimes called a low-level language by some, and high-level language
                    by others. I will refer to it as a mid-level language. Due to it's mid-level-ness.
                    This means that like a low-level language you will need to manage your memory manually,
                    but there are ways to use the computer to do it for you. You don't have the ability,
                    in C++, to manually tweak the processor, but you do have <i>access,</i> to call languages
                    that can do that. (High-level languages don't even let you think about that.)
                </p>
                <h3>Can we look at the Language sometime today?</h3>
                <p>Sure, let's do that right now.</p>
                <p>Here is our first program.</p>
                <pre><code class="c++">
int main()
{
    return 0;
}
                </code>
                    Output:
                                        <code class="plaintext"> 
                                        </code>
                                    </pre>
                <p>This super advanced program does.... absolutely nothing. Well kind of. It actually
                    does 2 things. It starts and it ends. Upon ending it tells the operating system (OS)
                    that everything ending perfectly fine and that nothing went wrong.
                </p>
                <p>Now would probably be a good time to set up a development environment on your computer.
                    <a href="GettingSetUp.html">This</a> document is helpful in that regard.
                </p>
                <p>Ok, let's look at something that actually does <i>something.</i></p>
                <pre><code class="c++">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
                </code>
Output:
                    <code class="plaintext">
Hello World!
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>This will display on your screen in a terminal or command-prompt window:<br>
                    Hello World!<br>
                    Let's look at what is happening here. First we are including `iostream`.
                    This is code that was written by someone else so that you have the ability
                    to input from the console and output to it.
                </p>
                <p>Once we have added all of thier code we have our int main() line. This is always
                    the starting point of our programs. So we are starting our program here.
                </p>
                <p>Next we have some {} curley brace symbols. These are used to group things together.
                    For now, just know they are needed.
                </p>
                <p>On the next line the magic happens. When you include iostream it basically is like
                    dropping a bucket into your code with a bunch of commands that you can use. One
                    command is called cout (pronouced: "see-out"). To use it, you first need to say
                    "look in the STandarD bucket". So we have `std::cout`. This is saying you'll find
                    `cout` in the `std` bucket. Then we pass in our phrase. Lastly, we dig in the bucket
                    for `endl` which means "end line".
                </p>
                <p>Return 0 means return the error code 0 to the OS. Again this means no error occured.</p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Well there you have it. An very basic example of what the language looks like. Hopefully,
                    you understand that it is compiled which means that run-time <i>should be</i> faster.
                    Also that C++ has manually memory management so it isn't as "easy" as a high-level
                    language, but with lack of ease comes more power.
                </p>
                <p>If you have made it this far and are not spooked away from the language, you should
                    continue to learn it and as you learn it you will find some of the tools in the simplex-lib
                    will make your life easier and hopefully make the language feel a bit higher level than
                    it is normally.
