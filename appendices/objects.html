                <h1>Functions and Objects</h1>
                <p>When you are programming a good principle to adhear to is the "DRY" principle,
                    or quite simply "Don't Repeat Yourself". Anytime you find yourself doing copy
                    and paste three times or more, it is probably a good idea to use a function.
                    And if you have a bunch of functions that relate to a common task, it is probably
                    a good time to bring them together into a class.
                </p>
                <h3>Functions</h3>
                <p>So what exactly is a function? A function is a piece of code that can be reused.
                    Let's start with a very simplisitic C++ example. Let's say you have this code.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="c++">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
                    </code>
Output:
                    <code class="plaintext">
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>So this is a very simple example that will say Hello World! three times. In this example,
                    yes, we could have used a loop, but let's not play devil's advocate. Let's say that
                    instead of saying "Hello World", we want to say "Good bye World". We would have to
                    change it 3 times. So in something more complex, this could be challenging to make sure
                    that you really "fixed" your code in all the places. This is where functions come into
                    play. Let's rewrite this with a function.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="c++">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

void printMessage();

int main()
{
    printMessage();
    printMessage();
    printMessage();

    return 0;
}

void printMessage()
{
    std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
}
                    </code>
Output:
                    <code class="plaintext">
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    So we can see here that right below our iostream include, we have what is called
                    a function prototype. This tells the compiler that in the future we are going to
                    have a function and it will look like this.
                </p>
                <p>By looking at the prototype the first word we have is `void`. Void means that it
                    is not returning anything back. It is named printMessage. And right now () means
                    it is a function. We will get into more detail below.
                </p>
                <p>In our main... function. Yes that is right main is also a function. We see that
                    we have printMessage(); three times. This means call the function.
                </p>
                <p>Below the main function we have the implementation of our function. And it says to
                    print Hello World.
                </p>
                <p>Let's change this so this so that it can accept parameters.</p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="c++">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

void printMessage(const char* message);

int main()
{
    printMessage("Hello World");
    printMessage("Good bye World");
    printMessage("Hello World");

    return 0;
}

void printMessage(const char* message)
{
    std::cout << message << std::endl;
}
                    </code>
Output:
                    <code class="plaintext">
Hello World
Good bye World
Hello World
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>This code looks almost the same except that now see that the prototype has
                    `const char*` in between the parenthesis. This means that it now is accepting
                    a constant pointer to a character (ie: string), called message. In the main
                    function we then pass in a message. And in our implementation, instead of hard-coding
                    a message we use whatever was sent in.
                </p>
                <h3>Function Overloading</h3>
                <p>Overloading functions allows you do special things based on the type that is passed in.</p>
                <p>To keep things simple, right now we are passing a string into our printMessage function.
                    What if we wanted to send in a number? Let's say specifically an integer? You might
                    thing that you could just do: printMessage(123);
                    However, this will not compile. printMessage only accepts a `const char*` not a
                    `int`.
                </p>
                <p>Let's update our code to accept an int.</p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="c++">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

void printMessage(const char* message);
void printMessage(int number);

int main()
{
    printMessage("Hello World");
    printMessage(123);
    printMessage(456);

    return 0;
}

void printMessage(const char* message)
{
    std::cout << message << std::endl;
}
void printMessage(int number)
{
    std::cout << number << std::endl;
}
                    </code>
Output:
                    <code class="plaintext">
Hello World
123
456
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>There we have fixed that issue, but let's say that we wanted to do more with
                    functions. Let's say we wanted to make a function that can add two numbers
                    together.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="c++">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

void printMessage(const char* message);
void printMessage(int number);
int sum(int number1, int number2);

int main()
{
    printMessage("Hello World");
    int total = sum(123 + 456);
    printMessage(total);
    printMessage(sum(123+456));

    return 0;
}

void printMessage(const char* message)
{
    std::cout << message << std::endl;
}
void printMessage(int number)
{
    std::cout << number << std::endl;
}
int sum(int number1, int number2)
{
    return number1 + number;
}
                    </code>
Output:
                    <code class="plaintext">

                </pre>
                <p>Our code is starting to get longer. Now you will see there is a new function
                    called `sum`. It doesn't say `void` it says `int`. That means it will return
                    an `int` type when it is done. It also accepts two ints. One called number1
                    and one called number2. If we jump down to the implementation we see that it
                    says it will take number1 + number2 and then return it.
                </p>
                <p>In our main function we see it being used a couple times. The first time we are
                    creating a new variable called total. And we are using our function to sum the
                    two numbers together. Next we tell our printMessage to display the value of total.
                    The line below that, we don't create a variable and use it. We just tell printMessage
                    to show whatever it gets back from sum. These lines do the exact same thing.
                </p>
                <h3>Custom Types</h3>
                <p>Up to this point we have worked with the `char*` and `int` types. We have inputed
                    these types into a function and we have returned the types back our of the function.
                </p>
                <p>Let's look at a new example and see where a custom type might be helpful.</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

void printAge(int age);
void printMonthBuilt(int month);

int main()
{
    int carAge = 3;
    int carMonthBuilt = 1; //Jan
    int truckAge = 10;
    int truckMonthBuilt = 3; //March

    printAge(carAge);
    printMonthBorn(carMonthBuilt);
    printAge(truckAge);
    printMonthBorn(truckMonthBuilt);

    return 0;
}

void printAge(int age)
{
    std::cout << "Vehicle is " + age + " years old." << std::endl;
}

void printMonthBuilt(int month)
{
    std::cout << "Built in month: " + month << std::endl;
}
                    </code>
Output:
                    <code class="plaintext">
Vehicle is 3 years old.
Built in month: 1
Vehicle is 10 years old.
Built in month: 3
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>In this example, we have 2 vehicles and each has an age and a month it was built in.
                    We also have 2 functions. One prints out some text with the age information and
                    one prints out some text on the month it was built information.
                </p>
                <p>Let's add our custom type and look at the differences.</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

void printAge(int age);
void printMonthBuilt(int month);

struct Vehicle
{
    int age;
    int monthBorn;
    int numberWheels;
};

int main()
{
    Vehicle car;
    car.age = 3;
    car.monthBuilt = 1; //Jan
    car.numberWheels = 4;
    Vehicle truck;
    truck.age = 10;
    truck.monthBuilt = 3; //March
    truck.numberWheels = 6;

    printAge(car.age);
    printMonthBorn(car.monthBuilt);
    printAge(truck.age);
    printMonthBorn(truck.monthBuilt);

    return 0;
}

void printAge(int age)
{
    std::cout << "Vehicle is " + age + " years old." << std::endl;
}

void printMonthBuilt(int month)
{
    std::cout << "Built in month: " + month << std::endl;
}
                    </code>
Output:
                    <code class="plaintext">
Vehicle is 3 years old.
Built in month: 1
Vehicle is 10 years old.
Built in month: 3
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>So the first thing we notice is that we have created a `struct` short for
                    structure. It is named "Vehicle" and this is our custom types name.
                    And our struct contains two `int`s in it. One is called age and
                    one is called monthBuilt. And we also added how many wheels it has.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Previously we created an `int` called carAge and carMonthBuilt. Now we are creating
                    an `Vehicle` called car. Then we can set it's age and month built by using car.age
                    and car.monthBuilt.
                </p>
                <p>We are almost to object oriented programming. But, before we get to that last
                    step I want to point out that the differences between "car" and `Vehicle`.
                    "car" is technically an object, or more properly an instance. `Vehicle` is a type
                    and a way to think of it is that it is a blueprint. If you go to a factory
                    and look at the blueprint it describes everything about the vehicle.
                    When you actually build the vehicle it is an object.
                </p>
                <p>To further explain this difference between a type and an object. Let's experiment
                    with our Vehicle type. This type says we need 3 things to have vehicle. An
                    age, a month it is built, and a number of wheels. Let's say we are in the factory
                    building `Vehicle`s and it is January. We decide to make a car with 4 wheels.
                    It's age is 0, and it's month built is 1. And it has 4 wheels.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="c++">
struct Vehicle
{
    int age;
    int monthBorn;
    int numberWheels;
};

int main()
{
    Vehicle car1;
    car1.age = 0;
    car1.monthBuilt = 1; //Jan
    car1.numberWheels = 4;

    Vehicle car2;
    car2.age = 0;
    car2.monthBuilt = 1;
    car2.numberWheels = 4;

    return 0;
}
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>Let's say something happens when `car2` is driving down the road and one of it's
                    wheel fall off. Now car2.numberWheels will equal 3. `car2` two is an object, 
                    and it has 3 wheels. `car1` still has 4 wheels because it is a different object.
                    Notice that by a wheel falling off, the blue prints still say it must have wheels
                    and that the blue prints don't say how many wheels.
                </p>
                <h3>Objects</h3>
                <p>Let me start out by saying that `class` and `struct` mean the same thing. The
                    only difference is that all the parts of a class are private by default and
                    all the parts of a struct are public by default. That is the only difference.
                </p>
                <p>Let's have some vehicles and some animals now.</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

void printAnimalAge(int age);
void printVehicleAge(int age);

int main()
{
    int dogAge = 1;
    int truckAge = 3;

    printAnimalAge(dogAge);
    printVehicleAge(truckAge);

    return 0;
}

void printAnimalAge(int age)
{
    std::cout << "Animal is " + age + " years old." << std::endl;
}

void printVehicleAge(int age)
{
    std::cout << "Vehicle is " + age + " years old." << std::endl;
}

                    </code>
Output:
                    <code class="plaintext">
Animal is 1 years old.
Vehicle is 3 years old.
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>Now in this example we have a dog and a truck. Both have ages, so we need to make
                    sure we use the right function. If we don't use the right function it will tell
                    us the vehicle age of our dog and the animal age of our truck. Let's make some
                    custom types and see if we can improve this code to prevent us from making mistakes.
                </p>
                <pre>
                     <code>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

class Animal
{
    public:
    int age;
    void printAge()
    {
        std::cout << "Animal is " + age + " years old." << std::endl;
    }
}

class Vehicle
{
    public:
    int age;
    void printAge()
    {
        std::cout << "Vehicle is " + age + " years old." << std::endl;
    }
}

int main()
{
    Animal dog;
    dog.age = 1;

    Vehicle truck;
    truck.age = 3;

    dog.printAge();
    truck.printAge();

    return 0;
}

                    </code>
Output:
                    <code class="plaintext">
Animal is 1 years old.
Vehicle is 3 years old.
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>This has made things quite a bit simplier. Both types have a printAge and an age.
                    Beyond that, we can never print "Animal is...." for a Vehicle and we can never
                    print "Vehicle is..." for an animal. Also, we don't need to pass around the age
                    variable anymore. In printAge() it just says look for the age of the object and
                    use whatever value it is.
