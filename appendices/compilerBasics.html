                <h1>Compiler Basics</h1>
                <p>The first question is what is a compiler? There are 3 types of code. One type is
                    code machine code. Very few people write directly in machine code so we will
                    ignore that. The second type is interpreted code. This is code that is written
                    in a way that most people can understand it and while it is running a program
                    called an interpreter converts it into machine code. This happens every time 
                    the program is run. The third type is compiled code. This is code that is written
                    in a way that people can understand, but then before it can be run, it must be
                    turned into machine code by a program called a compiler. This is compiled once
                    and then can be run over and over.
                </p>
                <p>For the purpose of this document, it will be assumed that you know what objects
                    and functions are. To read up on that you can click <a href="objects.html">here.</a>
                </p>
                <p>Generally in C++ your classes are written using PIMPL, where you have header files
                    (.hpp, .hxx, .h) and source files (.cpp, .cxx). You can read more about PIMPL 
                    <a href="pimpl.html">here.</a>
                </p>
                <p>When compiling there are two steps that we work with. The compiler and the linker.
                    The compiler converts human readable code into machine code. The linker combines
                    the code together and will remove where the code is duplicated and will make
                    sure that all the code can run from file to file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We probably will need an example to explain this...
