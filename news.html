                <h1>News</h1>
                <h3>November 2020</h3>
                <p> A fair amount of changes have happened in November. Some of the new classes added are
                    a Singleton class for making sure that singleton's get destructed when the program is
                    winding down. A Thread class for calling a function on a thread. 
                </p><p>
                    There is now a Dictionary class which is a wrapper for std::unordered_map. To accomidate
                    this update, the string class now supports hashing. Also, classes derrived from object 
                    now will have a getHash() method. By default it is based just on the pointers address 
                    so every object is unique. However, it is virtual so that if the object should support 
                    hashing getHash() can be overridden and updated to do proper hashing for the class. 
                    Then this bit of code will need to be added to the header so that std::hash can be used.
                </p><p>
                    template<> struct std::hash<custom::class><br>
                    {<br>
                        size_t operator()(const custom::class& obj) const noexcept<br>
                        {<br>
                            return obj.getHash();<br>
                        }<br>
                    };<br>
                </p>
                <h3>May 2020</h3>
                <p>It's been a while since a major update, however, we now have one. Lots of classes have 
                    implementation to them now. VSCode compile and launch scripts have been added for those 
                    interested in using VSCode. In addition to that main.cpp is now included which essentially 
                    is a script for testing various things. 
                </p>
                <h3>January 2020</h3>
                <p>This month has been the initial commits of the simplex library. During this month the
                    creation of the string class has begun to take shape as well as some addition classes.
                </p>
                <p>Nothing is close to being stable yet but the documentation is being written along with 
                    the classes and methods in a hope that there will not be a large build up of undocumented 
                    methods.
