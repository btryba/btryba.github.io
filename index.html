                <h3>Simplex-Lib</h3>
                <p>The Simplex-Lib project is a library with the sole purpose of trying to make programming
                    in C++ easier. Generally when people program in C++ they are focused on speed and file
                    size. If they want convience they go to Python, Java or C#. Personally, rather than trying
                    to get multiple languages to work together, I would rather work in one langauge with
                    extensions.
                    <br><br>
                    Simplex-Lib is very object orriented as everything derrives from the class simplex::object.
                    There is a focus to build on top the standard templating library as well. This means whenever
                    the standard libraries get enhanced they should automatically come for free when Simplex-Lib
                    is rebuilt.
                    <br><br>
                    Furthermore, the library is licensed under the BSD license so you are free to either dynamically
                    link or statically build it into your application.

                <h3>Simplex-TUI</h3>
                <p>The Simplex-TUI project is a toolkit for creating text user infaces for use in the console.
                    The library leverages the ncurses library for maximum capability but strives to make it
                    as easy as possible to generate easy to maintain interfaces.

                <h3>November 2020</h3>
                <p>A fair amount of changes have happened in November. Some of the new classes added are
                    a Singleton class for making sure that singleton's get destructed when the program
                    is winding down. A Thread class for calling a function on a thread. 
                    <br><br>
                    There is now a Dictionary class which is a wrapper for std::unordered_map. To 
                    accomidate this update, the string class now supports hashing. Also, classes derrived 
                    from object now will have a getHash() method. By default it is based just on the pointers 
                    address so every object is unique. However, it is virtual so that if the object should 
                    support hashing getHash() can be overridden and updated to do proper hashing for the 
                    class. Then this bit of code will need to be added to the header so that std::hash can 
                    be used.
                    <br><br>
                    template<> struct std::hash<custom::class><br>
                    {<br>
                        size_t operator()(const custom::class& obj) const noexcept<br>
                        {<br>
                            return obj.getHash();<br>
                        }<br>
                    };<br>
